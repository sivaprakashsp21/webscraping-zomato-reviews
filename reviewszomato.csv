229956861,Shiv Kushwaha,14 days ago,"I called the place 2 days before to reserve a table during an event and confirmed a table reservation with the appropriate charges to be paid. I followed up as well on the day of the event as well for the table confirmation and i was assured that it is confirmed . After clearing up my schedule for the day and travelling an hour to reach the place before time as i was advised , I was stopped at the entry by the management and was told that Ill not get a table. I called the number provided and they told me they will try and i might not get a table. But the management at the gate straight up refused to get me a table unless i paid an exorbitant price of 10k+ for 2 people. This utter mismanagement ruined my entire schedule for the day and night as well. Why bother taking a reservation? If people have to face this upon reaching the venue. A really mismanaged place with no chain of command.",1,dining

We were shifted to another restraunt which is co-owned by them at my best guess. It had one of the worst food I have ever had with a below average service and co-operation. The cafe should just put closed if they have a party booking because this is a scam in my opinion. You look for a place, research for it, book a table by giving advance money and then have to dine-in at a completely different place. This does not make sense to me.",1,dining_order

185441895,DrRanjitha,6 months ago,"Went to secret story last evening for the match and my experience was far from what i expected it to be.<br/>The food which has always been excellent, was below average.<br/>We ordered :<br/>1)Goat cheese and masala potato waffles-DISASTER!<br/>Guess what we got!. Potato masala ( which you would generally have with poori), few pieces of goat cheese thrown over, and a normal savory waffle. This was an absolute fail cause if this was meant to be a fusion dish, it was not. The potato obviously did not go well with the waffle and the cheese was a complete mismatch to the entire dish. Rating : 0/5<br/>2)Chicken kurumelagu skeweres- decent. 3/5<br/>3)Filo triangles with stuffed ricotta and spinach-completely bland and tasteless. 1/5<br/><br/>So apart from the food being a disappointment, the staffs were equally so.<br/>We were two of us and chose to take a 7 seater as they said ‚Äúwe can sit wherever we want‚Äù. The place was practically empty and we made a prior table reservation . <br/>Midway into our meal - 2 waiters came up to us and asked us to move to a smaller table, which was understandable had they informed us before we started our orders. It is a basic courtesy to not ask the guests to move midway into their meal. Its not just discourteous but also extremely disrespectful. I blatantly refused for which they insisted again saying that all the couches are reserved prior . We had our reservations made prior too and informed that it was the two of us only. Well in that case they should have informed us of the same before we took up the table. This is completely an uncouth behaviour from the staffs. <br/>Overtall a terrible experience <br/>Would i recommend this place- NO<br/>Would i visit this place again- NEVER",1,dining

141719761,Ganesh,"Jun 27, 2023","The Worst Food I've Ever Tasted,<br/><br/>How do I even begin to describe the terrible culinary disaster that I witnessed? Words alone are incapable of expressing the total disappointment and contempt I felt upon taking my first mouthful of what can only be referred to as a culinary horror. This was without a doubt the worst cuisine I've ever had the displeasure to come across.<br/><br/>My expectations were high as I entered the eatery. The menu offered a wide selection of tempting foods, and the atmosphere seemed to be pleasant enough. I had no idea that I was about to go on a gourmet adventure that would permanently alter my taste buds.<br/><br/>The appetiser was a supposedly ""delicacy"" that defied all reason. When it was placed in front of me, an offensive smell that made my stomach turn immediately hit my senses. I took a bite with heavy heart, only to be met by an offensive mash-up of flavours that clashed ferociously. It seems as though the chef had deliberately set out to compose a symphony of disgust.<br/><br/>The level of disappointment with the main meal was quite different. The food was served lukewarm, and it had a haphazardly put together appearance. I expected redemption with every bite, but what I got was an incomprehensible taste that made me doubt the fundamentals of culinary science. It was an odd mixture of overdone, underseasoned, and strangely weird flavours. It was obvious that no amount of seasoning would be able to save this terrible dish.<br/><br/>The dessert put the icing on the cake and put an end to my eating experience. I had no idea how a straightforward sweet dish could turn out so disastrously. It had an odd texture, unrecognisable flavours, and a bad aftertaste that persisted long after I had left the restaurant.<br/><br/>I was disappointed, and that's an understatement. The food that was served to me was disrespectful to the culinary arts as well as my taste sensibilities. It was lacking in taste, refinement, and attention to detail. I was left wondering how such a restaurant could even continue to operate while subjecting unknowing diners to such a horrible experience.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the worst meal I've ever had was a miserable experience from beginning to end. It was a dining experience that I would much rather forget, from the unappealing odours to the mismatched flavours and poor execution. I can only hope that people will avoid this restaurant and spare themselves the culinary disaster I experienced.",1,dining_order

We had visited the secret story in bangalore a few weeks back and we had such a wonderful experience there, so we decided to give the chennai one a shot being our anniversary. It was definitely not worthed. We arrived around 10ish after we visited some friends at radio room. We were stopped right at the entrance by this lady and not allowed inside. We were told that we had pre drinks and their club rules doesn't allow customers inside If they have had pre drinks, we have never heard such things like this anywhere else. Yes we visited radio room to see some friends for early dinner and had 2 drinks there. Isnt that normal. It was a Saturday night and obviously people go to different places. And we wanted to try this place. We were told that we had pre drinks in our car. The funny part is how did the lady assume that, are customers followed from their car? These kind of statements is definitely not good customer service. Totally unprofessional and it ruined our anniversary. We have visited so many places in chennai whenever we come, this has never happened. We are regular at radio room and have never experienced something like this before.

122824685,Disha Oberoi,"Dec 16, 2022","Below average, extra oily and unnecessarily spicy food. <br/><br/>We ordered the squid rings, fish n chips and the lamb ‚Äústew‚Äù (chef‚Äôs recommendation- shockingly) that looked nothing like a stew - picture attached. <br/><br/>The berry mocktail was essentially a strawberry milkshake. Utterly disappointing.<br/><br/>Unless you have an under evolved palette, avoid it. The only plus - the glass top, naturally lit space.",2,dining

And the manager said the entire restaurant was given for a ‚Äúprivate party‚Äù who booked later than we did. Bad management and no courtesy to inform the guests. Definitely a no go. ,2,dining

So is the vibe. <br/>However the one I complaint that I‚Äôve is that the stuff is extremely rude and mean. <br/>We were given a table and each time we ordered they‚Äôd present us the bill and ask to pay immediately.<br/>So the third time I told them to not add any service tax (as it was added before , and of course the tax).. to which the staff told my friends that how would you like sitting at the bar counter? <br/>We weren‚Äôt even informed before that we‚Äôd be getting the bill like this , else we would have ordered everything together.",3,dining

116792856,Mehul,"Oct 05, 2022","The place has a good vibe and ambiance. Loved that they have a well thought out elaborate menu and the DJ plays good music. <br/><br/>The food concepts are good but I found the flavours to be average and could be improved. Having said that few of the items - Spanakopita,  the broccoli, and pizza were very good. The Pav bhaji buns, salad could do with some improvements. The pinwheel roti with Daal is a nice touch and was good. <br/><br/>The high seats were not the most comfortable and the ladies in our group found them uncomfortable after a short while. Tables are compact and not enough room when ordering a meal, ok for starters. <br/><br/>Cocktails again looked so good on the menu, but need flavour balancing and refinement to be a wow factor. Hope this improves as the place matures. ",4,dining
